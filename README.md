## Description

** A Simple YouTube Guessing Game **

<p align="center">

</p>

H8 FIGHTER is a simple guessing game where the user sees two random YouTube videos and guesses which one has the most dislikes. 

### The Story

As you can tell from the starting page, I came up with this idea when news came out that YouTube is now hiding the dislike count in all of its videos. 

The dislike button is the least offensive way to express displeasure towards a video for any reason. Whether the video is outright bad, the video expresses an opinion that you don't agree with or just for the sake of being controversial.

I created this project using technologies that weren't taught in bootcamp, so I had to rely heavily on tutorial videos to make it work. The like-to-dislike ratio is a good indicator of telling whether a video serves its purpose, regardless of its quality. Unfortunately, I have to use a third party to access this feature. 

## How to Play

Compare the two videos and guess which one has the most dislikes.

Click the green target button of that video and the results will show up.

Can you get a high score of 10?
